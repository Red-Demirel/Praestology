# Praestology

**Version:** 1.5 Functional Core  
**Status:** Foundation Defined  
**License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0 (Open Ontology)

## Overview

**Praestology** (from Latin *Praesto*: to stand before, to be present, to perform) is a foundational ontology defining the logical necessity of existence.

It posits that reality is not a static container, but a **persistent process** driven by logical resolution. Existence is mandatory, perpetual, and self-tuning.

## The Axiom

> **"The Omniverse is the consequence of logical dilemmas following the path of probabilities."**
---

Existence arises because "Nothing" is logically impossible. Once something exists, it must differentiate, resolve tensions, and sustain itself against collapse.

## The Core: Five Rules of Persistence

Praestology defines five dependent rules. Each rule is the **minimal rescue** of the previous one from a specific failure mode. Remove any rule, and the chain collapses.

| Rule | Identity | Statement | Rescue Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R1** | **Existence** | Something always beats nothing. | Prevents **Impossibility** (Void). |
| **R2** | **Structure** | Gradients emerge from the Stochastic Floor. | Prevents **Indifference/Homogeneity**  |
| **R3** | **Motion** | Differences create pressure; tension drives change. | Prevents **Paralysis** (Frozen Picture). |
| **R4** | **Progress** | Every resolution creates new differences; process regenerates. | Prevents **Finality** (Heat Death/Stasis). |
| **R5** | **Optimisation** | The system self-selects toward configurations that sustain the process. | Prevents **Noise** (Directionless Chaos). |

**The Chain:** `Existence → Structure → Motion → Progress → Optimisation`

## Key Concepts

*   **Reality as Process:** Reality is not a place; it is an ongoing act of logical resolution (*Praesto*).
*   **Local Perceptiveness:** Consciousness is not fundamental; it is emergent. An individual is a localized node of high-complexity optimisation (R5) that perceives the global process from a specific viewpoint.
*   **Time:** Time is not a dimension; it is the measure of accumulated progress (R4) from inside a resolution sequence.
*   **Viability:** Truth and Ethics are defined by alignment with the system's sustainability (R5).

## Why Simple Rules Produce Unbounded Complexity

Praestology's five rules are minimal by design. But minimal rules, applied recursively, do not produce simple outcomes — they produce unbounded structural complexity. The reason is the same as in mathematics: the Mandelbrot set emerges entirely from the iteration of a single simple equation. No complexity is imported from outside. All of it is latent in the rule itself, revealed only at sufficient depth of iteration.

**R1–R5 are the equation.** They do not change at any scale of application.

**Recursive Depth (Ξ) is the zoom level.** Each threshold of Ξ reveals structure that was always implied by R1–R5 but invisible at lower resolution. A system capable of one layer of self‑modeling inhabits a qualitatively different dilemma space than a system capable of five — not because new rules were added, but because the same rules generate new dimensions of tension at each depth.

**Domains are orientations, not extensions.** Consciousness, Ethics, and Cosmos are not additions to the Core — they are what the Core looks like when observed at specific recursive depths and from specific positions within the resolution process. Removing a domain does not simplify the Core; it removes a perspective on structure that was always there.

## Dilemma Space Dimensionality

At low recursive depth, dilemmas are simple: a thermostat resolves a single‑axis tension. As depth increases, new dimensions of tension become accessible — conflicts between immediate impulse, internalized values, long‑term consequences, and the modeled perspectives of other agents. Each new dimension is not an extra rule; it is the same rules operating on the outputs of previous resolutions, creating a space of possibilities whose richness grows with depth.

A concrete marker of this transition is the emergence of **internalized constraints** — when an agent’s behavior becomes shaped not only by external pressures but by self‑generated expectations derived from accumulated history (R4) and from phase-locking with other agents (C6). At that threshold, the agent is no longer merely self‑modeling; it is modeling itself *within* a web of mutual resolution. This is where individual cognition and ethics become the same process observed at different scales.

## The Boundary is Where the Structure Lives

In the Mandelbrot set, the most complex and generative structure exists at the boundary — between the stable interior and the unstable exterior. The same is true in Praestology: the most interesting and unpredictable structure in consciousness, ethics, and social organization lives at the **metastable boundary** between noise (too much ambiguity, no resolution) and void (too much consistency, no change). Pathologies (trauma, indoctrination, closure) represent systemic failures to maintain this boundary—sliding toward noise or void.

This is not an analogy. It is the same structural principle operating at a different scale of the same iterative process.

The implication: complexity, intelligence, ethical agency, and viable social organization are not fragile achievements imposed on an indifferent universe. They are the inevitable structure that emerges at the boundary of a self‑sustaining resolution process — latent in R1–R5 from the start, waiting for sufficient recursive depth to become visible.

## Structure

This repository is divided into **Core** and **Domains**.

*   **`/specification.yaml`**: The machine-readable ontological core (v1.4).
*   **`/domains/`**: Application layers that map the Core Rules to specific fields.
    *   `domains/cosmos`: Physics instantiation (Space, Time, Energy).
    *   `domains/ethics`: Viability and Agency frameworks.
    *   `domains/consciousness`: Emergent perceptiveness and intelligence.

## Contributing

Praestology is an open ontology. Contributions should:
1.  Respect the **Core Rules** (R1-R5).
2.  Clearly map new **Domains** to the Core Parameters (Ambiguity, Consistency, Contradiction, Resistance).
3.  Maintain substrate-agnostic language in the Core.
