# Praestology

**Version:** 1.5 Functional Core  
**Status:** Foundation Defined  
**License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0 (Open Ontology)

## Overview

**Praestology** (from Latin *Praesto*: to stand before, to be present, to perform) is a foundational ontology defining the logical necessity of existence.

It posits that reality is not a static container, but a **persistent process** driven by logical resolution. Existence is mandatory, perpetual, and self-tuning.

## The Axiom

> **"The Omniverse is the consequence of logical dilemmas following the path of probabilities."**
---

Existence arises because "Nothing" is logically impossible. Once something exists, it must differentiate, resolve tensions, and sustain itself against collapse.

## The Core: Five Rules of Persistence

Praestology defines five dependent rules. Each rule is the **minimal rescue** of the previous one from a specific failure mode. Remove any rule, and the chain collapses.

| Rule | Identity | Statement | Rescue Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R1** | **Existence** | Something always beats nothing. | Prevents **Impossibility** (Void). |
| **R2** | **Structure** | **C2: Gradients** | **Differentiation.** Homogeneity collapses due to precision cost. Gradients emerge from the Stochastic Floor. |
| **R3** | **Motion** | Differences create pressure; tension drives change. | Prevents **Paralysis** (Frozen Picture). |
| **R4** | **Progress** | Every resolution creates new differences; process regenerates. | Prevents **Finality** (Heat Death/Stasis). |
| **R5** | **Optimisation** | The system self-selects toward configurations that sustain the process. | Prevents **Noise** (Directionless Chaos). |

**The Chain:** `Existence → Structure → Motion → Progress → Optimisation`

## Key Concepts

*   **Reality as Process:** Reality is not a place; it is an ongoing act of logical resolution (*Praesto*).
*   **Local Perceptiveness:** Consciousness is not fundamental; it is emergent. An individual is a localized node of high-complexity optimisation (R5) that perceives the global process from a specific viewpoint.
*   **Time:** Time is not a dimension; it is the measure of accumulated progress (R4) from inside a resolution sequence.
*   **Viability:** Truth and Ethics are defined by alignment with the system's sustainability (R5).

## Structure

This repository is divided into **Core** and **Domains**.

*   **`/specification.yaml`**: The machine-readable ontological core (v1.4).
*   **`/domains/`**: Application layers that map the Core Rules to specific fields.
    *   `domains/cosmos`: Physics instantiation (Space, Time, Energy).
    *   `domains/ethics`: Viability and Agency frameworks.
    *   `domains/consciousness`: Emergent perceptiveness and intelligence.

## Contributing

Praestology is an open ontology. Contributions should:
1.  Respect the **Core Rules** (R1-R5).
2.  Clearly map new **Domains** to the Core Parameters (Ambiguity, Consistency, Contradiction, Resistance).
3.  Maintain substrate-agnostic language in the Core.
