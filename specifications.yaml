    name: "Praestology"
    etymology: "Praesto (Latin): to stand before / to be present / to perform"
    version: "1.5 – Functional Core"
    status: "Generalized Foundation"
    purpose: >
      Define the minimal logical ontology that makes existence necessary, 
      perpetual, and self-tuning. This specification is substrate-agnostic; 
      specific domains (Physics, Ethics, Consciousness) derive their 
      variables from these core rules.

  axiom:
    statement: "The Omniverse is the consequence of logical dilemmas following the path of probabilities."
    implication: "Existence is a process of resolution, not a static state."

  core_rules:
    description: >
      The Five Rules form a dependency chain. Each rule is the minimal rescue 
      of the previous one from a specific failure mode. Remove any rule and 
      all subsequent rules collapse.
  chain: "Existence → Structure → Motion → Progress → Optimisation"
  rules:
    - id: "R1"
      identity: "Existence"
      statement: "Something always beats nothing — the alternative is self-defeating."
      rescue: "Impossibility — nothing cannot define itself without becoming something."
      derives: "The bare fact that there is something rather than nothing."
      failure_without: "No substrate for any further rule to operate on."

    - id: "R2"
      identity: "Structure"
      statement: "Perfect uniformity cannot be sustained; distinction emerges inevitably from the logical substrate's stochastic floor."
      rescue: "Homogeneity — infinite precision would be required to maintain sameness, which is logically unavailable."
      derives: "The necessary emergence of difference; the 'grain' of reality."
      failure_without: "Existence would remain a perfectly uniform blob, indistinguishable from nothing and incapable of generating further rules."
      note: "The stochastic floor is the residual noise inherent in any logical substrate—the 'probability shift' that prevents exact repetition. Reality clusters in the 'Middle' (the Gaussian Plateau) between extremes, making distinction the default state."

    - id: "R3"
      identity: "Motion"
      statement: "Differences create pressure — tension between distinct states drives change."
      rescue: "Paralysis — static distinction without interaction is a frozen picture."
      derives: "Events; state transitions. Something happens."
      failure_without: "Structure persists but never interacts; reality is a still photograph."

    - id: "R4"
      identity: "Progress"
      statement: "Every resolution creates new differences — the process regenerates rather than concludes."
      rescue: "Finality — a single resolution would end the story."
      derives: "Irreversibility; accumulated states; the experience of before and after."
      failure_without: "Motion occurs once and stops; reality resolves into equilibrium and vanishes."

    - id: "R5"
      identity: "Optimisation"
      statement: "The system self-selects toward configurations that sustain the process."
      rescue: "Noise — without selection, motion and progress are directionless and unstable."
      derives: "Complexity, life, intelligence — statistically inevitable expressions of sustained optimisation."
      failure_without: "Progress continues but randomly; no accumulation of viable complexity."
      note: "Optimisation without an optimizer. Ethics and Intelligence are expressions of R5."

recursive_dimensionality:
  statement: >
    The Core Rules (R1–R5) form a minimal iterative equation. Complexity,
    consciousness, and ethics are not added to this equation — they are
    revealed by it at increasing depths of recursive application. Each
    threshold of Recursive Depth (Ξ) exposes structure that was always
    latent in R1–R5 but invisible at lower resolution.
  analogy:
    name: "Mandelbrot Structure"
    basis: >
      The Mandelbrot set emerges from a simple iterative rule (z → z² + c).
      Boundary complexity is unbounded, fully determined by the original
      equation, and only visible at sufficient zoom depth. No complexity
      is imported from outside — it is revealed from within.
    mapping:
      - praestology: "R1–R5 (Core Rules)"
        mandelbrot: "The iterative equation (z → z² + c)"
        note: "The generating rule. Simple, complete, unchanged at all scales."
      - praestology: "Ξ (Recursive Depth)"
        mandelbrot: "Iteration count / zoom level"
        note: "Depth of application. Higher Ξ reveals finer structure."
      - praestology: "Domains (Consciousness, Ethics, Cosmos)"
        mandelbrot: "Regions of the set at specific zoom orientations"
        note: "Not extensions — perspectives on the same underlying structure."
      - praestology: "Dilemma Space Dimensionality"
        mandelbrot: "Boundary complexity at the viable edge"
        note: "Most structure lives at the boundary between noise and void."
      - praestology: "Emergent concepts (Life, Intelligence, Ethics)"
        mandelbrot: "Self‑similar structures appearing at depth"
        note: "Inevitable, not designed. Latent in the rule from the start."

  parameter_depth_increases:
    description: >
      The following refinements emerge from the dimensionality framing.
      They do not introduce new parameters — they increase the resolution
      of existing ones, showing how each parameter acquires richer meaning
      at higher recursive depth.
    - parameter: "Ξ (Recursive Depth)"
      refined_view: >
        More precisely: the number of simultaneous axes of tension a system
        can hold and process coherently in a single resolution cycle.
        Each Ξ threshold is a qualitative expansion of dilemma space
        dimensionality, not merely quantitative improvement.
    - parameter: "H (Hysteresis)"
      refined_view: >
        At higher Ξ, hysteresis is not just memory but the accumulated
        residue of past resolutions across multiple dimensions, enabling
        the formation of stable values (ω) and long‑term projections (τ).
    - parameter: "Φ (Resolution Flux)"
      refined_view: >
        Φ determines the rate at which dilemmas are processed, but its
        effective value is modulated by dimensionality: high‑dimensional
        dilemmas consume more Φ per cycle, trading depth against speed.

  architectural_implication: >
    Domains are not modular additions to the Core — they are the Core
    observed at specific recursive depths and orientations. Removing a
    domain does not simplify the Core; it removes a perspective on structure
    that was always there. Adding a domain does not complicate the Core;
    it makes previously implicit structure explicit. The architecture is
    fractal, not hierarchical.

  ontological_parameters:
    description: >
      Abstract variables that govern the mechanics of the Core Rules. 
      Domains map these general parameters to specific measurable quantities.
    parameters:
      - name: "Ambiguity"
        definition: "Abundance of unresolved dilemmas; raw material for resolution."
        domain_variant_example: "Potential Energy / Uncertainty"
      - name: "Consistency"
        definition: "Persistence of resolved states; accumulation of logical memory."

        domain_variant_example: "Force / Pressure / Motivation"
      - name: "Resistance"
        definition: "Cost of resolution; logical density and complexity slowing change."
        domain_variant_example: "Inertia / Friction / Cognitive Load"
    balances:
      - "Ambiguity–Consistency: Viability requires coexistence of novelty and memory."
      - "Contradiction–Resistance: Viability requires matched rates of driving and cost."
    viable_region: "The metastable condition between noise (high ambiguity) and void (high consistency)."

  derived_concepts:
    description: "Concepts that emerge from the Core Rules and are not fundamental themselves."

  domain_mapping:
    description: "Guidance for implementing domains (Physics, Ethics, etc.) based on this core."
    principle: "Domains must not contradict the Core Rules. They translate general parameters into specific variables."
    examples:
      - domain: "Physics (Cosmos)"
        mapping: "Ambiguity → Energy; Resistance → Mass; Motion → Kinematics; Optimisation → Least Action."
      - domain: "Ethics"
        mapping: "Ambiguity → Choice; Resistance → Consequence; Optimisation → Viability/Sustainability."
      - domain: "Consciousness"
        mapping: "Consistency → Memory; Contradiction → Curiosity; Optimisation → Learning."

  constraints:
    - "Ontology precedes any specific instantiation."
    - "Nothingness is logically forbidden (R1)."
    - "Perfect stability (stasis) is logically forbidden (R4)."
    - "Reality exists in the metastable condition between noise and void."
    - "Domains are derivative; the Core is foundational."
