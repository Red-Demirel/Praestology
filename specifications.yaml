    name: "Praestology"
    etymology: "Praesto (Latin): to stand before / to be present / to perform"
    version: "1.5 – Functional Core"
    status: "Generalized Foundation"
    purpose: >
      Define the minimal logical ontology that makes existence necessary, 
      perpetual, and self-tuning. This specification is substrate-agnostic; 
      specific domains (Physics, Ethics, Consciousness) derive their 
      variables from these core rules.

  axiom:
    statement: "The Omniverse is the consequence of logical dilemmas following the path of probabilities."
    implication: "Existence is a process of resolution, not a static state."

  core_rules:
    description: >
      The Five Rules form a dependency chain. Each rule is the minimal rescue 
      of the previous one from a specific failure mode. Remove any rule and 
      all subsequent rules collapse.
  chain: "Existence → Structure → Motion → Progress → Optimisation"
  rules:
    - id: "R1"
      identity: "Existence"
      statement: "Something always beats nothing — the alternative is self-defeating."
      rescue: "Impossibility — nothing cannot define itself without becoming something."
      derives: "The bare fact that there is something rather than nothing."
      failure_without: "No substrate for any further rule to operate on."

    - id: "R2"
      identity: "Structure"
      statement: "Perfect uniformity cannot be sustained; distinction emerges inevitably from the logical substrate's stochastic floor."
      rescue: "Homogeneity — infinite precision would be required to maintain sameness, which is logically unavailable."
      derives: "The necessary emergence of difference; the 'grain' of reality."
      failure_without: "Existence would remain a perfectly uniform blob, indistinguishable from nothing and incapable of generating further rules."
      note: "The stochastic floor is the residual noise inherent in any logical substrate—the 'probability shift' that prevents exact repetition. Reality clusters in the 'Middle' (the Gaussian Plateau) between extremes, making distinction the default state."

    - id: "R3"
      identity: "Motion"
      statement: "Differences create pressure — tension between distinct states drives change."
      rescue: "Paralysis — static distinction without interaction is a frozen picture."
      derives: "Events; state transitions. Something happens."
      failure_without: "Structure persists but never interacts; reality is a still photograph."

    - id: "R4"
      identity: "Progress"
      statement: "Every resolution creates new differences — the process regenerates rather than concludes."
      rescue: "Finality — a single resolution would end the story."
      derives: "Irreversibility; accumulated states; the experience of before and after."
      failure_without: "Motion occurs once and stops; reality resolves into equilibrium and vanishes."

    - id: "R5"
      identity: "Optimisation"
      statement: "The system self-selects toward configurations that sustain the process."
      rescue: "Noise — without selection, motion and progress are directionless and unstable."
      derives: "Complexity, life, intelligence — statistically inevitable expressions of sustained optimisation."
      failure_without: "Progress continues but randomly; no accumulation of viable complexity."
      note: "Optimisation without an optimizer. Ethics and Intelligence are expressions of R5."

  ontological_parameters:
    description: >
      Abstract variables that govern the mechanics of the Core Rules. 
      Domains map these general parameters to specific measurable quantities.
    parameters:
      - name: "Ambiguity"
        definition: "Abundance of unresolved dilemmas; raw material for resolution."
        domain_variant_example: "Potential Energy / Uncertainty"
      - name: "Consistency"
        definition: "Persistence of resolved states; accumulation of logical memory."
        domain_variant_example: "Mass / Structure / Memory"
      - name: "Contradiction"
        definition: "Driving force compelling dilemmas to resolve; urgency of change."
        domain_variant_example: "Force / Pressure / Motivation"
      - name: "Resistance"
        definition: "Cost of resolution; logical density and complexity slowing change."
        domain_variant_example: "Inertia / Friction / Cognitive Load"
    balances:
      - "Ambiguity–Consistency: Viability requires coexistence of novelty and memory."
      - "Contradiction–Resistance: Viability requires matched rates of driving and cost."
    viable_region: "The metastable condition between noise (high ambiguity) and void (high consistency)."

  derived_concepts:
    description: "Concepts that emerge from the Core Rules and are not fundamental themselves."
    concepts:
      - name: "Time"
        source: "R4 (Progress)"
        definition: "Accumulated progress measured from inside a resolution sequence."
      - name: "Complexity"
        source: "R5 (Optimisation)"
        definition: "Stable configurations that survive successive optimisation cycles."
      - name: "Life"
        source: "R5 (Optimisation)"
        definition: "Self-maintaining optimisation loops above a critical complexity threshold."
      - name: "Intelligence"
        source: "R5 (Optimisation)"
        definition: "Optimisation processes that model their own resolution dynamics."
      - name: "Ethics"
        source: "R5 (Optimisation) + R1 (Existence)"
        definition: "Optimisation constraints that preserve the cycle for all cycle-aware agents."

  domain_mapping:
    description: "Guidance for implementing domains (Physics, Ethics, etc.) based on this core."
    principle: "Domains must not contradict the Core Rules. They translate general parameters into specific variables."
    examples:
      - domain: "Physics (Cosmos)"
        mapping: "Ambiguity → Energy; Resistance → Mass; Motion → Kinematics; Optimisation → Least Action."
      - domain: "Ethics"
        mapping: "Ambiguity → Choice; Resistance → Consequence; Optimisation → Viability/Sustainability."
      - domain: "Consciousness"
        mapping: "Consistency → Memory; Contradiction → Curiosity; Optimisation → Learning."

  constraints:
    - "Ontology precedes any specific instantiation."
    - "Nothingness is logically forbidden (R1)."
    - "Perfect stability (stasis) is logically forbidden (R4)."
    - "Reality exists in the metastable condition between noise and void."
    - "Domains are derivative; the Core is foundational."
