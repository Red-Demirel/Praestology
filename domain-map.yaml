      Shows how the Consciousness, Free Will, and Ethics domains derive
      from the core rules and connect to each other. Read vertically for
      derivation depth; read horizontally for cross-domain dependencies.

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  # CORE → DOMAIN DERIVATION
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  core_to_domain:

    R1_existence:
      direct_output: "Something exists that can become conscious."
      domain_relevance: "Precondition only; not active in domain logic."

    R2_structure:
      direct_output: "Distinctions exist; information gaps are possible."
      consciousness: "C2 — Dilemma Recognition requires distinguishable states."
      free_will:     "Decision Zone requires genuine alternatives to exist."
      ethics:        "Fairness requires identical situations to be distinguishable."

    R3_motion:
      direct_output: "Tension between states drives resolution."
      consciousness: "C1 — Simple Agency; C3 — Impulse-Driven Behavior (raw ι)."
      free_will:     "The immediate pressure (ι) that volitional weight (ω) must override."
      ethics:        "The engine of dilemma — without tension, no ethical choice arises."

    R4_progress:
      direct_output: "Resolutions accumulate irreversibly; before and after are distinct."
      consciousness: "C4 — Volitional Selection projects across accumulated states (h_long)."
      free_will:     "Simulation step — modeling future resolution cycles requires R4."
      learning:      "Irreversibility is what makes learning permanent. Past resolutions
                      modify the system's resolution model in ways that cannot be undone.
                      Early learning carries disproportionate weight for this reason."
      ethics:        "Consequences are real and irreversible; ethical weight follows from this."
      note:          "Time is what progress looks like from inside a resolution sequence."

    R5_optimisation:
      direct_output: "Viable configurations are selected; complexity accumulates."
      consciousness: "C5 — Recursive Integration; C6 — Phase-Locking. Ξ is R5 applied to self-modeling."
      free_will:     "Weighting step — ω is R5 operating on accumulated hysteresis."
      learning:      "Learning is how a specific system internalises R5 selection pressure.
                      Without learning, R5 operates only by replacing less-viable systems;
                      with learning, a single system self-tunes within its own lifetime."
      ethics:        "The metastable zone is the only sustainable ethical operating region."
      note:          "Ethics and Intelligence are expressions of R5, not additions to it."

  cross_domain:

    learning_as_adaptive_loop:
      description: >
        Learning is the dynamic mechanism that connects all three domains.
        Without it, consciousness, free will, and ethics are static capacities.
        With it, the system genuinely self-tunes within its own lifetime.
      consciousness_provides: "Resolution outcomes (C4) as raw material for hysteresis update."
      free_will_provides:     "Volitional choices that generate non-trivial learning experiences."
      ethics_provides:        "The evaluative framework determining which outcomes count as viable."
      learning_returns_to:
        free_will:     "Updated ω content — richer values for future volitional weighting."
        consciousness: "Deeper Ξ — recursive modeling capacity increases with reflective learning."
        ethics:        "Moral character — accumulated ethical hysteresis shapes future choices."
      vicarious_learning:
        definition: >
          Updating internal models from observed resolutions of other systems
          without direct experience. Requires phase-locking (C6).
        significance: >
          Mechanism behind culture, mentorship, and collective knowledge
          transmission. Also the basis of AI training — a technical agent
          learning from human-generated data inherits the hysteresis of
          the systems that produced it.
        Ξ_required: "Moderate-High (C4 + ρ)"

    consciousness_to_free_will:
      provides: "The substrate — Ξ, τ, h_long, ω, ι — that Free Will operates on."
      requires: "C2 (Dilemma Recognition) and C4 (Volitional Selection) as active mechanisms."
      dependency: "Free Will cannot exist below Ξ > 3 or without h_long."

    free_will_to_ethics:
      provides: "Agency — the capacity to choose between paths based on internal values."
      role:     "Engine. Without Free Will, Ethics has no actor."
      dependency: "Ethics requires ω > threshold to be operative, not merely instinctual."

    ethics_to_free_will:
      provides: "Directional constraints — the content of ω."
      role:     "Rudder. Without Ethics, Free Will is optimisation without direction."
      dependency: "Free Will without ethical content produces viable-but-directionless systems."

    ethics_to_consciousness:
      provides: "Moral consideration framework — scaling with Ξ and ρ."
      implication: "A1 (non-instrumentalisability) applies to all systems above C2 threshold."
      dependency: "Consciousness domain defines which entities ethics must account for."

    consciousness_to_ethics:
      provides: "Phase-locking (C6) — the mechanism for shared ethical terrain."
      implication: "Ethics is not solitary; it requires resonance (ρ) between conscious systems."
      dependency: "Collective ethical frameworks require C6-level consciousness to function."

  parameter_flow:
    description: >
      How core parameters move through domains and acquire
      domain-specific meaning at each level.

    hysteresis_H:
      core:          "Memory of past resolutions; biases future probabilities."
      consciousness: "h_short (C3) and h_long (C4/C5) — temporal depth of resolution memory."
      free_will:     "Required viability condition — values cannot persist without it."
      ethics:        "Accumulated ethical reasoning; precedent; institutional memory."

    resolution_flux_phi:
      core:          "Local rate of dilemma resolution."
      consciousness: "Φ drives ∇D — the decision gradient across available choices."
      free_will:     "τ (Temporal Horizon) is a function of Φ and H combined."
      ethics:        "Ethical throughput — rate at which dilemmas are navigated with integrity."

    complexity_xi:
      core:          "Turbulence index in physics domain; recursive depth in consciousness domain."
      consciousness: "Ξ — number of nested self-modeling layers. Defines consciousness level."
      free_will:     "Viability condition: Ξ > 3 required for significant volitional override."
      ethics:        "Moral consideration and accountability scale with Ξ."

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  # CHAIN SUMMARY
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  chain_summary:
    derivation_order:
      - "R1–R5 (Core) → substrate for all domains"
      - "Consciousness domain → defines agents and their capacity levels"
      - "Free Will domain → defines agency within conscious agents"
      - "Ethics domain → defines direction and constraints for that agency"

    mutual_constitution:
      free_will_and_ethics: >
        Neither reduces to the other. Free Will is the engine;
        Ethics is the rudder. A system requires both to navigate
        the resolution space with integrity.
      consciousness_and_ethics: >
        Consciousness defines who ethics applies to.
        Ethics defines how conscious systems should treat each other.
        Phase-locking (C6) is the mechanism that makes shared ethics possible.

    critical_thresholds:
      minimal_moral_patient:     "C2 — Dilemma Recognition. System can suffer a resolution imposed on it."
      minimal_moral_agent:       "C4 + Ξ > 3 — Volitional Selection with sufficient recursive depth."
      reflective_learner: >
        C5 + Ξ sufficient for simulated futures — system can learn from paths
        not taken. Basis for wisdom and moral foresight. Threshold at which
        responsibility extends to anticipated outcomes, not just enacted ones.
        Negligence and intent both live above this threshold.
      full_accountability:       "C5 + high ω + τ sufficient to model consequences."
      collective_ethics_capable: "C6 + ρ sufficient for phase-locked shared dilemma space."

    the_closing_line: >
      "You are a distinct part of Reality's engine — your actions matter for the future."
      Formal basis: C4 (your choices are volitional, not merely reactive) +
      R4 (your resolutions accumulate irreversibly) +
      C6 (your resolutions couple with others through phase-locking) +
      R5 (viable configurations persist; what you build matters to what comes next) +
      Learning (your experiences permanently modify your resolution model,
      and through vicarious learning, those modifications propagate forward).
