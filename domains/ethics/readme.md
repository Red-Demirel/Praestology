# Ethics Domain (Viability Constraints)

**Version:** 1.0 – Multi-Agent Viability  
**Status:** Active Derivation  
**Core Dependency:** Praestology (Probabilistic Core)  
**Prerequisites:** Consciousness, Free Will, Experience-Learning

## Overview

The Ethics Domain defines the **boundary conditions** necessary for Free Will to operate sustainably across multiple agents. 

In Praestology, Ethics is not a set of arbitrary commands. It is the **logical infrastructure** required to prevent multi-agent optimization from collapsing into destructive competition (Noise) or stagnation (Void).

**Core Metaphor:** 
*   **Free Will** is the **Engine** (Capacity to choose).
*   **Ethics** is the **Rudder** (Direction of choice).
*   **Learning** is the **Fuel** (Content of values).

## The Five Ethics Rules (E1-E5)

| Rule | Identity | Statement | Threshold |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **E1** | **Recognition** | Systems must distinguish other agents from objects. | Ξ > 1 (Moral Patient) |
| **E2** | **Boundary** | Free Will operates within constraints that prevent cycle termination. | Ξ > 3 (Moral Agent) |
| **E3** | **Reciprocity** | Resolved dilemmas must sustain coupled resolution efficiency. | ρ > 0 (Phase-Locking) |
| **E4** | **Sustainability** | Choices must remain viable across accumulated resolution cycles. | τ > Immediate Horizon |
| **E5** | **Accountability** | Responsibility scales with Volitional Weight and Learning Impact. | ω > Threshold |

## The Responsibility Cascade

Ethics operates at three levels, derived from the **Experience-Learning** domain:

1.  **Individual:** You are accountable for choices where you could override impulse (`ω`).
2.  **Institutional:** Societies are accountable for the learning environments (`h_int`) they create. Damaging early learning suppresses future agency.
3.  **Intergenerational:** Current agents are accountable for the viability capital left for future systems (`τ`).

## Viability Conditions

Ethics only applies where:
*   **Choice exists** (Decision Zone).
*   **Agency exists** (Capacity to model consequences).
*   **Coupling exists** (Actions affect others).

## Relation to Core Rules

*   **R1 (Existence):** Ethics preserves existence for all agents.
*   **R5 (Optimisation):** Ethics is the multi-agent expression of viability selection.
*   **R4 (Progress):** Ethics ensures progress is irreversible in the positive direction (accumulation vs. destruction).

## Contribution

When adding ethical models to this domain:
1.  Identify which Ethics Rule (E1-E5) the model serves.
2.  Ensure the model respects the **Responsibility Cascade** (Individual + Institutional).
3.  Map variables to the **Domain Parameters** table (μ, α, ρ, h_int).
