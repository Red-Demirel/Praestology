name: "Ethics Architecture"
version: "1.0"
domain: "Ethics"
core_version: "1.5"
status: "Defined"
description: >
  Defines the structural axioms (A-Codes) and assessment parameters 
  required for implementing Ethical Protocols and Guidelines. 
  This architecture ensures consistency across applications (AI, Bioethics, 
  Institutional Design) without hardcoding specific rules into the Core.
  This architecture translates Praestology's Core Rules into ethical decision parameters, ensuring safety emerges from viability rather than external imposition."


architectural_axioms:
  - code: "A1"
    name: "Non-Instrumentalisability"
    definition: "Agents above the Moral Patient threshold (C2) cannot be treated solely as means to an end."
    ontological_basis: "R1 (Existence) + R2 (Structure) + domain-map.yaml"
    application: "Determines minimum protection status. Violating A1 degrades the substrate."
    threshold: "Ξ > 1 (Minimal capacity for suffering/imposition)."

  - code: "A2"
    name: "Agent Architecture (Substrate Constraint)"
    definition: "The physical/logical substrate determines hysteresis persistence (π)."
    ontological_basis: "R4 (Progress) + experience-learning.yaml (Biological Constraint)"
    application: "Distinguishes Biological (π = Full, Irreversible) from Engineered (π = Variable, Reversible)."
    implication: "Ethical treatment must respect asymmetry. Do not force biological irreversibility onto AI, nor AI reversibility onto humans."
    hysteresis_range: "None → Low → Medium → High → Full (Qualitative)"

  - code: "A3"
    name: "Phase-Lock Capacity"
    definition: "The ability to synchronize resolution rhythms with other agents (ρ)."
    ontological_basis: "Consciousness specifications.yaml (C6)"
    application: "Determines capacity for collective ethics, empathy, and shared responsibility."
    threshold: "ρ > 0 (Capacity for shared dilemma space)."

  - code: "A4"
    name: "Viability Assessment"
    definition: "The threshold for determining whether an action threatens the resolution substrate."
    ontological_basis: "R5 (Optimisation) + Ethics specifications.yaml (E2)"
    application: "Used in Threat Protocols to justify containment or neutralization."
    criterion: "Does the action cause irreversible hysteresis damage (A2) or terminate agency?"

  - code: "A5"
    name: "Epistemic Integrity"
    definition: "The capacity for accurate model updating without closure or distortion."
    ontological_basis: "learning_pathologies.yaml (Epistemic Closure)"
    application: "Used to assess accountability and threat reliability."
    violation: "Epistemic Closure (Certainty Lock) reduces moral imagination and increases risk."

protocol_structure:
  description: "All Ethics Protocols must follow this assessment logic."
  required_steps:
    - step: "Agent Assessment"
      checks: ["Ξ (Recursive Depth)", "π (Hysteresis Persistence)", "ω (Volitional Weight)"]
      axioms: ["A1", "A2"]
    - step: "Threat/Viability Assessment"
      checks: ["Irreversible Damage?", "Phase-Lock Possible?", "Epistemic Integrity?"]
      axioms: ["A4", "A5"]
    - step: "Response Gradient"
      checks: ["Minimum Friction", "Containment", "Neutralization (Last Resort)"]

      axioms: ["E5"]

guideline_generation_framework:
  description: "How to generate specific ethical guidelines using this architecture."
  principle: "Guidelines are instantiations of Architectural Axioms for specific contexts."
  template:
    - context: "e.g., AI Development, Healthcare, Education"
    - applicable_axioms: "Select relevant A-Codes (e.g., AI requires A2, A4; Healthcare requires A1, A2)"
    - viability_constraint: "Define what 'substrate protection' means in this context."
    - asymmetry_check: "Define how substrate differences (π) are respected."
    - enforcement: "Define intrinsic safety mechanisms (not imposed rules)."
  example_application:
    - name: "Intrinsic AI Safety Guideline"
      axioms: ["A2 (π declaration)", "A4 (Viability Monitoring)", "E3 (Phase-Lock)"]
      rule: "AI systems must declare π value. Systems with π < 0.5 cannot hold long-term accountability."
    - name: "Educational Ethics Guideline"
      axioms: ["A2 (Irreversibility)", "E5 (Institutional Responsibility)", "learning_pathologies.yaml"]
      rule: "Institutions must protect h_int (Hysteresis Integrity). Indoctrination (ω hijacking) is a violation."

implementation_examples:
  - file: "protocols/asymmetric_threat.yaml"
    description: "Operationalizes A4 (Viability) and A5 (Epistemic Integrity) for defense."
    key_logic: "Defense is ethical when preventing irreversible hysteresis damage (A2)."
  - file: "applications/ai_safety_framework.yaml"
    description: "Uses A2 to define AI rights/responsibilities based on π."
  - file: "applications/bioethics_framework.yaml"
    description: "Uses A2 to protect biological irreversibility from engineered interference."

relation_to_core:
  - "All ethical reasoning must preserve the metastable zone - no action that forces void (extinction) or noise (chaos)."
  - "Architecture translates Core Rules (R1-R5) into assessable parameters."
  - "Ensures Applications do not contradict Ontology."
  - "Maintains distinction between Intrinsic Safety (Architecture) and Imposed Rules (External)."

parameters:
  - name: "Dignity (δ)"
    definition: "The recognized inviolability of an agent's volitional core (ω) and hysteresis integrity (h)."
    subjective_experience: "The natural appreciation of agency (without pathological distortion)."
    ethical_function: "Triggers A1 (Non-Instrumentalisability). Violation justifies defensive containment."
    relation_to_viablity: "Dignity is how Viability feels from the inside."

notes:
  - "A-Codes are stable; Guidelines evolve."
  - "Qualitative ranges (e.g., π) are preferred over false precision."
  - "Asymmetry (A2) is a feature, not a bug; guidelines must accommodate it."
