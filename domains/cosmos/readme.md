# Cosmos Domain (Physics Instantiation)

**Version:** 1.1 – Probabilistic Mapping  
**Status:** Active Derivation  
**Core Dependency:** Praestology v1.4 (Functional Core)

## Overview

The Cosmos Domain maps the abstract **Praestological Core Rules (R1-R5)** to physical phenomena. Physics is not the foundation; it is the **behavioral layer** that emerges when Logical Rules operate within a differentiated medium.

**Key Update (v1.1):** Distinction (Structure) is not merely required; it is statistically inevitable due to the **Probability Shift** against homogeneity.

## The Probability Shift (Mechanism for C2)

Homogeneity (perfect sameness) is not just invisible; it is **logically improbable**.

```yaml
the_probability_shift:
  homogeneity_status: "Logically improbable; requires infinite precision to maintain."
  inhomogeneity_source: "Stochastic Floor; residual noise in the logical substrate."
  broad_field_principle: "Reality clusters in the 'Middle' (The Gaussian Plateau) of the substrate's limits."
  implication: "Distinction emerges automatically from the inability to sustain perfect uniformity."
```

*   **The Stochastic Floor:** The base layer of existence contains residual logical noise.
*   **The Gaussian Plateau:** Viability is not at the extremes (Pure Noise vs. Pure Order). Reality exists in the probability peak where resolution is sustainable.

## The Emergence Sequence

Physical laws emerge as the logical process deepens, driven by the Probability Shift.

| Stage | Core Rule | Cosmos Rule | Physical Emergence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **R1: Existence** | **C1: The Field** | **Space/Volume.** Logical necessity creates a substrate. |
| **2** | **R2: Structure** | **C2: Gradients** | **Differentiation.** Homogeneity collapses due to precision cost. Gradients emerge from the Stochastic Floor. |
| **3** | **R3: Motion** | **C3: Dynamics** | **Force & Time.** Pressure between gradients drives resolution. |
| **4** | **R4: Progress** | **C4: Causality** | **Limits & Flow.** Resolution creates irreversibility (Entropy) and speed limits. |
| **5** | **R5: Optimisation** | **C5: Selection** | **Constants & Action.** System favors paths on the Gaussian Plateau (Viability). |

## The Five Cosmos Rules (C1-C5)

### C1: The Field (Existence)
*   **Core Link:** R1 (Existence)
*   **Statement:** "A substrate must exist to support distinction."
*   **Physical Variant:** Spacetime / Quantum Field.
*   **Rescue:** Prevents Void.

### C2: Gradients (Structure)
*   **Core Link:** R2 (Structure)
*   **Statement:** "Homogeneity is unstable; distinction emerges from the stochastic floor."
*   **Physical Variant:** Energy Gradients (∇Φ), Charge, Spin, Density Fluctuations.
*   **Rescue:** Prevents Featurelessness. **Mechanism:** Probability Shift away from infinite precision.
*   **Viability:** Reality clusters on the **Gaussian Plateau** (balanced differentiation).

### C3: Dynamics (Motion)
*   **Core Link:** R3 (Motion)
*   **Statement:** "Gradients create pressure; pressure drives resolution."
*   **Physical Variant:** Force (F), Time Dilation (Φ scaling), Inertia (Resistance).
*   **Rescue:** Prevents Stasis.

### C4: Causality (Progress)
*   **Core Link:** R4 (Progress)
*   **Statement:** "Resolution creates new states; the sequence cannot reverse."
*   **Physical Variant:** Entropy, Light Speed Limit (c), Arrow of Time.
*   **Rescue:** Prevents Equilibrium Death.

### C5: Selection (Optimisation)
*   **Core Link:** R5 (Optimisation)
*   **Statement:** "Paths that sustain resolution are favored over those that stall."
*   **Physical Variant:** Least Action, Stability of Constants, Conservation Laws.
*   **Rescue:** Prevents Chaos. **Mechanism:** Suppression of paths off the Gaussian Plateau.

## Mapping Parameters

| Praestological Parameter | Physics Variant | Unit/Measure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ambiguity** | Potential Energy / Uncertainty | Joules / ΔxΔp |
| **Consistency** | Mass / Structure | kg / Atomic Stability |
| **Contradiction** | Force / Pressure | Newtons / Pascals |
| **Resistance** | Inertia / Friction | Mass / Viscosity |
| **Resolution Rate (Φ)** | Frequency / Time | Hz / Seconds |

## Viability in Physics

In the Cosmos Domain, **Viability** equals **Stability on the Plateau**.
*   **True:** Physical laws that preserve the cycle (e.g., Conservation of Energy).
*   **False:** Configurations that lead to immediate collapse (e.g., Vacuum Decay, Singularities) or dissolve into noise.
*   **The Edge:** Singularities represent the failure of C4 (Progress) where resistance becomes infinite.

## Contribution

When adding physical models to this domain:
1.  Identify which Core Rule (R1-R5) the model serves.
2.  Ensure the model respects the **Probability Shift** (Homogeneity is the outlier, not the norm).
3.  Map variables to the **Praestological Parameters** table.
