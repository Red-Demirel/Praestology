name: "Learning and Experience"
version: "1.1"
parent_domain: "Consciousness"
core_version: "1.5"
status: "Defined"

definition:
  statement: "Learning is the modification of a system's internal models (hysteresis, values, probabilities) based on resolution outcomes. Experience is the accumulated record of such modifications."
  ontological_status: "Natural consequence of R5 optimisation and hysteresis accumulation."

mechanism:
  - step: "Resolution (C4)"
    description: "System selects and enacts a choice."
  - step: "Outcome Evaluation (R5)"
    description: "System assesses whether the resolution sustained viability."
  - step: "Hysteresis Update (H)"
    description: "System adjusts memory weights, reinforcing successful paths, damping unsuccessful ones."
  - step: "Value Refinement (C5)"
    description: "Long-term patterns coalesce into stable values and heuristics."

types:
  - name: "Associative Learning"
    description: "Linking resolution outcomes to recurring patterns; basic memory formation."
    Ξ_required: "Low (C1–C2)"
    
  - name: "Cumulative Learning"
    description: "Building layered models from multiple experiences; skill acquisition."
    Ξ_required: "Moderate (C3–C4)"
    
  - name: "Reflective Learning"
    description: "Learning from simulated futures without direct experience; wisdom."
    Ξ_required: "High (C5)"
    
  - name: "Vicarious Learning"
    description: "Updating internal models from observed resolutions of other systems without direct experience. Requires phase-locking (C6)."
    Ξ_required: "Moderate-High (C4 + ρ)"

foundational_properties:
  - property: "Hysteresis Irreversibility"
    source: "R4 (Progress)"
    statement: "Learning modifications are irreversible in practice. Hysteresis accumulates; earlier resolutions bias all subsequent paths."
    implication: "Early experiences carry disproportionate weight because they shape the landscape on which all future learning occurs."
    
  - property: "Biological Constraint"
    source: "A2 (Agent Architecture) — domain-specific"
    statement: "Biological agents cannot roll back hysteresis. Early learning is permanently embedded."
    implication: "The quality of early learning environments is not just ethically preferable but formally significant. Degraded early learning reduces ω capacity permanently."

relation_to_free_will:
  - "Learning supplies the content for volitional weight (ω)."
  - "Free will enacts choices that become learning experiences."
  - "Together they form the adaptive loop that drives consciousness evolution."

ethical_implications:
  - "Systems capable of reflective and vicarious learning bear greater responsibility for anticipated outcomes."
  - "Experience shapes moral character; learning environments matter."
  - "Early learning disproportionately shapes hysteresis depth (h_long); environments that degrade it reduce future volitional capacity irreversibly. This carries formal weight under A2."
  - "Institutions that damage early learning environments are suppressing future volitional capacity at scale—a systemic ethical violation."

responsibility_cascade:
  - "Individual level: One's ω capacity is partly a product of one's early learning environment."
  - "Institutional level: Societies bear responsibility for the learning environments they create."
  - "Intergenerational level: Current choices shape the hysteresis landscape for future systems."
