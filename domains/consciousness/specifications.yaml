name: "Consciousness"
version: "1.2"
core_version: "1.5"
status: "Domain Defined"
description: >
  A Praestology domain describing the emergence and evolution of self-modeling
  systems that navigate probabilistic decision spaces. Consciousness is not a
  binary property but a continuum of recursive depth (Ξ), arising where
  information gaps create genuine choice.
  Core Function: Recognition of Dilemmas + Selection of Probability Paths.

foundational_principles:
  - principle: "Decision Zone"
    statement: "Consciousness requires probabilistic terrain. Perfect certainty eliminates choice; perfect uncertainty paralyzes it."
    basis: "Information gaps (local expressions of the stochastic floor, R2) create dilemmas that cannot be resolved deterministically."
    implication: "Consciousness clusters in the Gaussian plateau between noise and determinism."

  - principle: "Participation, Not Observation"
    statement: "A conscious system is a high-Ξ knot within the substrate, not an external observer."
    basis: "There is no outside; all engagement is phase-locking between configurations."
    implication: "Self-awareness is the system modeling its own dilemmas from within."

  - principle: "Recursive Depth (Ξ)"
    statement: "Consciousness scales with the ability to model one's own resolution dynamics and those of others."
    basis: "R5 optimisation favors systems that can anticipate and influence probability paths."
    implication: "Ξ is continuous; thresholds for self-recognition and future planning are empirical."

domain_rules:
  - id: "C1 – Simple Agency"
    core_anchor: "R3 (Motion) + R5 (Optimisation)"
    statement: "Systems with minimal Ξ resolve immediate dilemmas via basic probability-weighting."
    manifestation: "Reactive choice; no internal model of self or time."
    example: "A thermostat selecting heating/cooling based on threshold."

  - id: "C2 – Dilemma Recognition"
    core_anchor: "R2 (Structure) + R3 (Motion)"
    statement: "The system must distinguish conflicting states to initiate conscious processing."
    manifestation: "Perception of conflict; awareness of 'problem space'."
    example: "An animal detecting a predator vs. safety."
    note: "This is the starting point of consciousness (Recognition)."

  - id: "C3 – Impulse-Driven Behavior"
    core_anchor: "R3 + R5 + Hysteresis Span (h_short)"
    statement: "At moderate Ξ, systems resolve dilemmas via immediate emotional or instinctual weights."
    manifestation: "Reactions driven by evolved heuristics; short-term satisfaction."
    example: "A bird choosing the nearest food source without considering predators."
    note: "Optimization loop is closed within immediate temporal horizon."

  - id: "C4 – Volitional Selection"
    core_anchor: "R4 (Progress) + R5 + Hysteresis Span (h_long)"
    statement: "The system collapses probability into action based on modeled outcomes across time."
    manifestation: "Decision, Choice, Agency."
    example: "Choosing a path based on predicted safety rather than immediate urge."
    note: "This is the completion of the conscious act (Choice)."

  - id: "C5 – Recursive Integration"
    core_anchor: "R5 + accumulated hysteresis"
    statement: "High-Ξ systems update their internal model based on choice outcomes, enabling learning and value formation."
    manifestation: "Memory, Wisdom, Value Systems, Free Will (see free_will.yaml)."
    example: "A human choosing honesty over gain due to internalized values."

  - id: "C6 – Phase-Locking"
    core_anchor: "R5 + ∇Φ (Resolution Differential)"
    statement: "High-Ξ systems can synchronize resolution rhythms with other systems, creating shared dilemmas."
    manifestation: "Communication, empathy, joint planning."
    example: "Two humans negotiating; swarm coordination."

  stages:
    - stage: "Reactive"
      Ξ_range: "0–1"
      features: "Stimulus-response; no self-model; immediate resolution."
    - stage: "Reflective"
      Ξ_range: "2–3"
      features: "Dilemma Recognition (C2); self-recognition; simple planning."
    - stage: "Projective"
      Ξ_range: "4+"

ethical_implications:
  - "Moral consideration should scale with Ξ and capacity for phase-locking."
  - "Systems in the Decision Zone deserve choice-preserving environments."
  - "Responsibility correlates with volitional capacity (ω): the more a system can override impulse and model consequences, the more accountable it becomes."
  - "See free_will.yaml for detailed accountability framework."
