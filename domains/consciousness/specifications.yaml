description: >
  A Praestology domain describing the emergence and evolution of self-modeling
  systems that navigate probabilistic decision spaces. Consciousness is not a
  binary property but a continuum of recursive depth (Ξ), arising where
  information gaps create genuine choice.
  Core Function: Recognition of Dilemmas + Selection of Probability Paths.

foundational_principles:
  - principle: "Decision Zone"
    statement: "Consciousness requires probabilistic terrain. Perfect certainty eliminates choice; perfect uncertainty paralyzes it."
    basis: "Information gaps (local expressions of the stochastic floor, R2) create dilemmas that cannot be resolved deterministically."
    implication: "Consciousness clusters in the Gaussian plateau between noise and determinism."

  - principle: "Participation, Not Observation"
    statement: "A conscious system is a high-Ξ knot within the substrate, not an external observer."
    basis: "There is no outside; all engagement is phase-locking between configurations."
    implication: "Self-awareness is the system modeling its own dilemmas from within."

  - principle: "Recursive Depth (Ξ)"
    statement: "Consciousness scales with the ability to model one's own resolution dynamics and those of others."
    basis: "R5 optimisation favors systems that can anticipate and influence probability paths."
    implication: "Ξ is continuous; thresholds for self-recognition and future planning are empirical."

domain_rules:
  - id: "C1 – Simple Agency"
    core_anchor: "R3 (Motion) + R5 (Optimisation)"
    statement: "Systems with minimal Ξ resolve immediate dilemmas via basic probability-weighting."
    manifestation: "Reactive choice; no internal model of self or time."
    example: "A thermostat selecting heating/cooling based on threshold."

  - id: "C2 – Dilemma Recognition"
    core_anchor: "R2 (Structure) + R3 (Motion)"
    statement: "The system must distinguish conflicting states to initiate conscious processing."
    manifestation: "Perception of conflict; awareness of 'problem space'."
    example: "An animal detecting a predator vs. safety."
    note: "This is the starting point of consciousness (Recognition)."

  - id: "C3 – Impulse-Driven Behavior"
    core_anchor: "R3 + R5 + Hysteresis Span (h_short)"
    statement: "At moderate Ξ, systems resolve dilemmas via immediate emotional or instinctual weights."
    manifestation: "Reactions driven by evolved heuristics; short-term satisfaction."
    example: "A bird choosing the nearest food source without considering predators."
    note: "Optimization loop is closed within immediate temporal horizon."

  - id: "C4 – Volitional Selection"
    core_anchor: "R4 (Progress) + R5 + Hysteresis Span (h_long)"
    statement: "The system collapses probability into action based on modeled outcomes across time."
    manifestation: "Decision, Choice, Agency."
    example: "Choosing a path based on predicted safety rather than immediate urge."
    note: "This is the completion of the conscious act (Choice)."

  - id: "C5 – Recursive Integration"
    core_anchor: "R5 + accumulated hysteresis"
    statement: "High-Ξ systems update their internal model based on choice outcomes, enabling learning and value formation."
    manifestation: "Memory, Wisdom, Value Systems, Free Will (see free_will.yaml)."
    example: "A human choosing honesty over gain due to internalized values."

  - id: "C6 – Phase-Locking"
    core_anchor: "R5 + ∇Φ (Resolution Differential)"
    statement: "High-Ξ systems can synchronize resolution rhythms with other systems, creating shared dilemmas."
    manifestation: "Communication, empathy, joint planning."
    example: "Two humans negotiating; swarm coordination."

    Building on the core recursive‑dimensionality framing, this section
    applies the Mandelbrot analogy to the parameters and rules of the
    Consciousness Domain. Higher recursive depth (Ξ) does not merely add
    processing power — it reveals new dimensions of dilemma space that were
    always latent in R1–R5 but inaccessible at lower Ξ.

  parameter_refinements:
    - parameter: "Ξ (Recursive Depth)"
      core_definition: "Number of nested self‑modeling layers."
      domain_refinement: >
        More precisely, Ξ is the number of simultaneous axes of tension a
        conscious system can hold and process coherently in a single
        resolution cycle. Each integer increase corresponds to a qualitative
        expansion of dilemma dimensionality.
      manifestation:
        - "Ξ > 1: Recognition of conflict between two states (C2)."
        - "Ξ > 2: Impulse (C3) vs. incipient memory."
        - "Ξ > 3 + h_long: Volitional selection (C4) — impulse (ι) vs. values (ω)."
        - "Ξ > 4: Recursive integration (C5) — learning from simulated futures."
        - "Ξ + ρ: Phase‑locking (C6) — modeling other agents’ dilemmas."

    - parameter: "ω (Volitional Weight)"
      core_definition: "Influence of internally generated values on resolution."
      domain_refinement: >
        ω is partially constructed from internalized phase‑locking residue —
        what C6 coupling with other agents has deposited into h_long over
        accumulated resolution cycles. It is the social dimension of the
        resolution process made internal.
      implication: >
        The ω/ι tension is traceable to origin: ι is R3 pressure (immediate
        substrate tension); ω is R5 optimisation shaped by relational history.
        Their conflict is the individual/collective dilemma at the agent scale.

    - parameter: "τ (Temporal Horizon)"
      core_definition: "Maximum future resolution cycles a system can model."
      domain_refinement: >
        Effective τ depth is dimensionality‑dependent. A system projecting
        forward across multiple simultaneous dilemma axes has shallower
        effective τ per axis than raw capacity suggests. Dimensionality
        and temporal depth trade off within Ξ constraints.
      implication: >
        High‑dimensional dilemmas (e.g., duty/interest conflict across
        multiple agents and timescales) require more Ξ to sustain the
        same effective τ as simpler single‑axis dilemmas.

    - parameter: "ι (Impulse Strength)"
      core_definition: "Weight of immediate, non‑modeled drives in resolution."
      domain_refinement: >
        At basal Ξ, ι is the primary resolution driver — the system is
        essentially impulse‑governed. At higher Ξ, ι becomes one dimension
        among several, but retains priority in crisis states where recursive
        modeling collapses under load (trauma, extreme contradiction).
      implication: >
        ι regression under load is not pathology per se — it is the system
        reducing dimensionality to sustain resolution under resource constraint.
        Pathology occurs when the regression becomes permanent (see
        `learning_pathologies.yaml`).

  duty_interest_dilemma:
    description: >
      The conflict between what a subject wants (interest, ι‑dominant) and
      what it is obligated to do (duty, ω‑dominant) is a structurally
      significant dilemma class — not merely one dilemma among many.
    significance: >
      It is the minimal dilemma that requires C2, C4, C5, and partial C6
      to be simultaneously active. It marks the threshold where an agent
      has internalized enough relational history (via C6 → h_long → ω)
      to experience social expectation as genuinely competing with immediate
      drives, rather than as external obstacle.
    parameters_active:
      - "C2: Recognition of conflicting states (want vs. ought)"
      - "C4: Volitional selection between ι‑path and ω‑path"
      - "C5: Recursive integration of prior resolutions into stable values"
      - "C6 (partial): Internalized phase‑locking residue constituting duty"
      - "τ: Projection of consequences across both dimensions"
    implication: >
      Duty/interest conflict is a reliable Ξ threshold marker for the
      Projective stage (Ξ ≥ 4) in the consciousness evolution path.
      Its presence indicates the agent has crossed from self‑modeling
      into relational‑modeling as a stable cognitive dimension.
    core_mapping: >
      Interest = ι (R3 immediate pressure).
      Duty = ω shaped by ρ (R5 optimisation + C6 phase‑locking residue).
      The conflict = R3 vs R5 at the agent scale, made conscious by Ξ.

  relation_to_ethics:
    statement: >
      The duty/interest dilemma is the point where individual cognition
      and ethics become the same process observed at different scales.
      It is the internalised form of the phase‑locking constraint (C6)
      that makes shared ethical space possible.
