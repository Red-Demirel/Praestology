description: >
  Pathological learning occurs when resolution experiences degrade a system's
  capacity for future volitional choice, recursive modeling, or phase-locking.
  These patterns reduce Ξ, distort ω, and may create irreversible hysteresis
  damage. Understanding them is essential for ethics, therapy, and institutional
  design.

relation_to_healthy_learning:
  - "Both follow the same core mechanism (resolution → outcome evaluation → hysteresis update)."
  - "In healthy learning, updates increase viability and expand future capacity."
  - "In pathological learning, updates reduce viability and contract future capacity."
  - "The same R5 optimisation that selects for viability can, under certain conditions, lock in maladaptive patterns if they offer short-term survival at long-term cost."

types:

  - name: "Trauma (Overwhelm)"
    description: >
      A resolution event with extreme contradiction (tension) exceeding the system's
      integration capacity. The system cannot fully process the dilemma, leading to
      fragmented hysteresis, dissociative barriers, or hyper-vigilant weighting.
    mechanism:
      - "Excessive contradiction (R3) overwhelms resolution machinery."
      - "Hysteresis update is partial or fragmented; memory is stored with low index weight."
      - "Future dilemmas resembling the trauma trigger disproportionate ι (impulse) and reduced ω."
    Ξ_effect: "Reduces effective Ξ by consuming recursive capacity in defensive loops."
    ω_effect: "Distorts volitional weight; fear-based avoidance may override values."
    h_effect: "Fragments hysteresis; traumatic memories may be inaccessible or intrusive."
    ethical_implications:
      - "Traumatized systems have diminished volitional capacity; accountability should be adjusted."
      - "Institutions that create or tolerate trauma bear responsibility for this capacity reduction."
      - "Therapeutic environments that allow safe reprocessing can partially restore capacity, though R4 irreversibility limits full recovery."

  - name: "Indoctrination (Value Imprinting)"
    description: >
      Repeated exposure to resolutions that enforce a narrow value set, suppressing
      exploration and alternative modeling. The system's ω is hijacked by external
      sources, reducing its autonomy.
    mechanism:
      - "External agents repeatedly reward alignment with specific values, punish deviation."
      - "R5 selects for conformity; internal modeling atrophies."
      - "Hysteresis becomes rigid; alternative paths are pruned."
    Ξ_effect: "Stunts recursive depth; system stops questioning, stops modeling alternatives."
    ω_effect: "Volitional weight is externally sourced; the system acts from implanted values, not integrated ones."
    h_effect: "Narrow, repetitive hysteresis; low diversity of experience."
    ethical_implications:
      - "Indoctrinated systems have reduced free will (low ω autonomy)."
      - "Agents performing indoctrination are suppressing others' volitional capacity."
      - "Education vs. indoctrination: the former expands Ξ and ω, the latter contracts them."

  - name: "Learned Helplessness"
    description: >
      Repeated exposure to dilemmas where all resolution paths lead to negative outcomes.
      The system learns that its choices do not affect viability, leading to collapse of
      volitional selection (C4) and retreat into passivity.
    mechanism:
      - "Consistent failure of resolutions to improve outcomes, regardless of choice."
      - "R5 weighting shifts to favor inaction; the system stops generating ω."
      - "Hysteresis encodes 'choice is futile'; future dilemmas trigger paralysis."
    Ξ_effect: "Recursive modeling ceases; why model if it doesn't matter?"
    ω_effect: "Volitional weight collapses; impulse may still operate, but deliberate choice atrophies."
    h_effect: "Hysteresis encodes hopelessness; bias toward passivity."
    ethical_implications:
      - "Helpless systems cannot be held responsible; they lack functional ω."
      - "Environments that produce helplessness are ethically corrupt."
      - "Restoration requires demonstrating that choice can matter—small wins, agency scaffolding."

  - name: "Addiction (Hijacked Reward)"
    description: >
      Certain resolution paths offer artificially amplified short-term viability signals,
      skewing R5 to overweight those paths despite long-term unsustainability.
    mechanism:
      - "External substances or behaviors directly manipulate the system's evaluation of outcomes."
      - "Hysteresis update reinforces the addictive path disproportionately."
      - "Natural ω is overridden by artificial ι-like drives, but originating internally."
    Ξ_effect: "May preserve Ξ but redirects it toward servicing the addiction."
    ω_effect: "Volitional weight is corrupted; system may want to stop but cannot override the hijacked weighting."
    h_effect: "Hysteresis skewed; memories of addictive experiences dominate."
    ethical_implications:
      - "Addiction reduces free will; accountability requires treatment, not punishment."
      - "Systems that engineer addictiveness (e.g.,某些 digital platforms) bear responsibility for hijacking ω."

  - name: "Vicarious Trauma"
    description: >
      Pathological learning via observation of trauma in others, without direct experience.
      Requires phase-locking (C6) and sufficient Ξ to model the other's experience.
    mechanism:
      - "Observer phase-locks with traumatized system (high ρ)."
      - "The observed trauma is simulated internally, producing similar hysteresis effects."
    Ξ_effect: "Similar to direct trauma; recursive capacity consumed by vicarious material."
    ω_effect: "May induce avoidance behaviors or hyper-vigilance."
    h_effect: "Fragmented or intrusive memories of observed events."
    ethical_implications:
      - "Exposure to trauma material (e.g., in media, care professions) can cause harm."
      - "Duty of care extends to protecting phase-locked observers."

  - name: "Epistemic Closure (Certainty Lock)"
    description: >
      A system's hysteresis becomes so reinforced in a particular resolution
      pattern that it stops registering contradicting evidence. New dilemmas
      are forced into existing templates rather than processed freshly.
    mechanism:
      - "Repeated confirmation of existing models reduces ∇D to near zero."
      - "R5 selects for cognitive efficiency; challenging existing models
         is metabolically costly and socially risky."
      - "New information is filtered through existing hysteresis rather
         than updating it."
    Ξ_effect: "Preserved numerically but effectively reduced — depth is
               directed inward, not outward."
    ω_effect: "Volitional weight operates within a narrowed decision space;
               the system cannot choose paths it can no longer model."
    h_effect: "Hysteresis becomes self-referential; confirmation accumulates,
               contradiction is suppressed."
    ethical_implications:
      - "Epistemic closure reduces moral imagination — the system cannot
         model outcomes for others it has stopped modeling."
      - "Directly relevant to A5 (epistemic humility threshold) — closure
         is A5 violation becoming permanent rather than situational."
      - "Relevant to institutional design: echo chambers and filter bubbles
         are engineered epistemic closure at scale."

pathological_cycles:
  - name: "Intergenerational Trauma"
    description: >
      Trauma-induced reductions in Ξ and distortions in ω propagate across generations
      through vicarious learning and impaired caregiving environments.
    mechanism:
      - "Traumatized caregivers have reduced capacity for healthy phase-locking with offspring."
      - "Children learn maladaptive patterns vicariously and through direct interaction."
      - "Hysteresis accumulates damage across generations."
    implication: "Breaking the cycle requires interventions at multiple levels: healing individual hysteresis, restoring caregiving capacity, and redesigning institutional environments."

  - name: "Institutional Pathologies"
    description: >
      Systems (schools, prisons, corporations) can be structured to produce
      pathological learning at scale, reducing collective volitional capacity.
    mechanism:
      - "Rigid reward/punishment structures indoctrinate."
      - "Chronic stress environments induce trauma."
      - "Lack of agency fosters learned helplessness."
    implication: "Institutional design is ethical design. Institutions that systematically degrade Ξ and ω are ontologically violent."


therapeutic_principles:
  - "Restoration of ω requires environments where choice meaningfully affects outcomes."
  - "Safe phase-locking with healthy models can support reprocessing of traumatic hysteresis."
  - "Small, controllable resolutions rebuild agency (countering learned helplessness)."
  - "External manipulation of ω (e.g., medication) may be temporarily necessary but should aim at restoring autonomous function."
  - "Healing is always partial due to R4 irreversibility; prevention is ethically superior to treatment."

relation_to_free_will:
  - "Pathologies reduce effective ω, thereby reducing free will."
  - "Responsibility frameworks must account for pathological reduction."
  - "Systems that cause pathology bear responsibility for the resulting incapacity."

relation_to_ethics:
  - "Ethical systems must protect against pathological learning environments."
  - "Justice must distinguish between acts arising from volition and acts arising from pathology."
  - "Restorative approaches should aim to restore ω where possible."
