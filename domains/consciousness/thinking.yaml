parent_domain: "Consciousness"
core_version: "1.5"
status: "Defined"
description: >
  Thinking is the structured internal process by which a conscious system
  navigates dilemma space before committing to resolution. It sits between
  Dilemma Recognition (C2) and Volitional Selection (C4) — the deliberative
  bridge that transforms raw tension into reasoned choice.
  Without thinking, consciousness operates at the impulse level (C3).
  Without consciousness, thinking is computation without an agent.
  Together they produce deliberate agency.

foundational_principles:
  - principle: "Thinking as Internal Resolution"
    statement: >
      Thinking is the system running resolution cycles internally, without
      committing to external action. It is dilemma navigation in simulation.
    basis: "R3 (Motion) + R4 (Progress) operating on internal representations."
    implication: >
      Thinking consumes resolution flux (Φ) without producing external hysteresis.
      It produces internal hysteresis — the updated model that guides future action.

  - principle: "Structured Tension Navigation"
    statement: >
      Thinking is not random association. It is directed movement through
      dilemma space, suppressing dead ends and amplifying viable paths.
    basis: "R5 (Optimisation) — viable reasoning paths are reinforced."
    implication: >
      Good thinking converges. Poor thinking cycles without resolution
      (rumination) or terminates prematurely (rationalisation).

  - principle: "Thinking as Pre-Commitment"
    statement: >
      The function of thinking is to increase the quality of volitional
      selection (C4) by reducing the probability space before ω is applied.
    basis: "Free Will v1.1 — Simulation step."
    implication: >
      Thinking expands effective τ (Temporal Horizon) without requiring
      real experience. It is vicarious resolution: cheap rehearsal before
      costly commitment.

domain_rules:
  - id: "T1 – Pattern Detection"
    core_anchor: "R2 (Structure)"
    statement: "The system identifies recurring distinctions and relationships in its input space."
    manifestation: "Recognition, categorisation, concept formation."
    example: "Noticing that two situations share structural features."
    Ξ_required: "Low (C1–C2)"
    note: "Precondition for all subsequent thinking rules."

  - id: "T2 – Tension Recognition"
    core_anchor: "R3 (Motion) + C2 (Dilemma Recognition)"
    statement: "The system detects conflict between patterns, models, or goals."
    manifestation: "Problem identification; awareness that a dilemma requires resolution."
    example: "Recognising that two valid conclusions contradict each other."
    Ξ_required: "Low-Moderate (C2)"
    note: "Thinking begins here. T1 without T2 is perception, not thought."

  - id: "T3 – Path Generation"
    core_anchor: "R3 + R4 (Progress)"
    statement: "The system generates candidate resolution paths from the tension state."
    manifestation: "Hypothesis formation, option generation, creative association."
    example: "Generating multiple approaches to a problem before evaluating them."
    Ξ_required: "Moderate (C3–C4)"
    note: >
      Quality of thinking depends heavily on path diversity here.
      Premature convergence (rationalisation) is T3 failure —
      the system generates only paths that confirm prior hysteresis.

  - id: "T4 – Path Evaluation"
    core_anchor: "R5 (Optimisation) + accumulated hysteresis"
    statement: "The system assesses candidate paths against viability criteria."
    manifestation: "Analysis, critique, consequence modeling, probability weighting."
    example: "Evaluating which approach is most likely to sustain long-term viability."
    Ξ_required: "Moderate-High (C4)"
    note: >
      Evaluation quality scales with τ (Temporal Horizon) and h_long depth.
      Short τ produces locally optimal but globally poor evaluations.

  - id: "T5 – Recursive Modeling"
    core_anchor: "R5 + C5 (Recursive Integration)"
    statement: "The system models the thinking process itself — meta-cognition."
    manifestation: "Awareness of one's own reasoning biases, errors, and blind spots."
    example: "Noticing that one's evaluation is being distorted by prior trauma or indoctrination."
    Ξ_required: "High (C5+)"
    note: >
      T5 is the thinking equivalent of C5 in consciousness.
      It enables correction of pathological thinking patterns from within, the system notices and adjusts its own reasoning distortions without external feedback.
      Without T5, pathological thinking (rumination, rationalisation,
      epistemic closure) cannot be self-corrected.

  - id: "T6 – Collaborative Thinking"
    core_anchor: "C6 (Phase-Locking) + R5"
    statement: >
      Phase-locked systems can extend their dilemma space across agents,
      pooling path generation and evaluation capacity.
    manifestation: "Dialogue, debate, collective reasoning, distributed cognition."
    example: "Two agents jointly modeling a problem neither could fully resolve alone."
    Ξ_required: "Moderate + ρ > 0"
    note: >
      Collaborative thinking is not averaging — it is genuine extension
      of the dilemma space. Phase-locked thinking produces conclusions
      neither agent would reach independently.

domain_parameters:
  - name: "Reasoning Depth (Ρ)"
    definition: "Number of sequential inference steps a system can sustain before resolution quality degrades."
    relation_to_core: "Function of Ξ and h_long — deep reasoning requires both recursive capacity and memory."

  - name: "Path Diversity (Δ)"
    definition: "Range of candidate resolution paths generated at T3."
    relation_to_core: "Inversely related to hysteresis rigidity — narrow prior experience produces narrow path sets."
    note: "Low Δ is the thinking-level signature of indoctrination."

  - name: "Convergence Rate (κ)"
    definition: "Speed at which the system reduces candidate paths to a resolution."
    relation_to_core: "Function of R5 optimisation pressure — high κ risks premature closure."
    note: >
      Optimal κ is context-dependent. High-stakes dilemmas require low κ
      (deliberate slowness). Low-stakes dilemmas can tolerate high κ
      (fast heuristics). A5 (Epistemic Humility) governs this calibration.

  - name: "Meta-Cognitive Accuracy (μ)"
    definition: "How accurately a system models its own reasoning process and biases."
    relation_to_core: "T5 capacity — requires Ξ sufficient for self-modeling."
    note: "Low μ is the parameter signature of epistemic closure."

thinking_pathologies:
  description: >
    These are failure modes where the thinking process deviates from viability, producing friction or stall instead of sustainable resolution. Parallel to learning_pathologies.yaml
    but operating at the reasoning level rather than the hysteresis update level.
    

  types:
    - name: "Rumination"
      description: "Repeated cycling through the same tension without generating new paths or reaching resolution."
      mechanism: "T3 failure — path generation loops without progress. R4 (Progress) is locally violated."
      signature: "High Φ consumption, zero external resolution, increasing ι."
      relation_to_pathologies: "Often co-occurs with trauma (high-index weight memories block path generation)."

    - name: "Rationalisation"
      description: "Premature convergence on a path determined by prior bias, with post-hoc justification."
      mechanism: "T4 failure — evaluation is reverse-engineered from conclusion."
      signature: "High κ, low Δ, low μ."
      relation_to_pathologies: "Mechanism of indoctrination operating at the reasoning level."

    - name: "Magical Thinking"
      description: "Path evaluation disconnected from causal substrate — conclusions not constrained by R3/R4."
      mechanism: "T4 operates on internally consistent but externally uncoupled models."
      signature: "High internal coherence, low external predictive validity."
      note: "Not necessarily pathological — useful in creative generation (T3) but dangerous in evaluation (T4)."

    - name: "Overthinking"
      description: "κ approaches zero — the system generates paths indefinitely without committing to resolution."
      mechanism: "R5 suppression of all paths due to excessive uncertainty weighting."
      signature: "High Δ, low κ, paralysis of C4."
      relation_to_pathologies: "Can co-occur with anxiety, learned helplessness (all paths feel non-viable)."

    - name: "Epistemic Closure"
      description: >
        The system stops generating new paths because existing hysteresis
        renders contradicting evidence invisible. See learning_pathologies.yaml.
      mechanism: "T1 filters inputs through existing models before T2 can detect genuine tension."
      signature: "Low Δ, high κ, low μ — fast confident conclusions on insufficient evidence."
      note: "A5 violation operating at the thinking level."

relation_to_free_will:
  - "Thinking is the simulation step in the Free Will mechanism (free_will.yaml)."
  - "Quality of thinking directly determines quality of volitional selection (C4)."
  - "T5 (Recursive Modeling) enables correction of ω distortions before they produce action."
  - "Without thinking, Free Will collapses to impulse-driven behavior (C3). Impulse is resolution without internal simulation — fast but low-τ, prone to short-term non-viable paths."

relation_to_learning:
  - "Thinking produces reasoning chains that become hysteresis content."
  - "Learning refines thinking heuristics — successful reasoning patterns are reinforced."
  - "T5 (meta-cognition) enables reflective learning from thinking errors without external experience."
  - "Thinking pathologies can become learning pathologies if uncorrected — rationalisation
     repeated becomes indoctrination of the self."

relation_to_ethics:
  - "Ethical deliberation is thinking applied to dilemmas involving other agents."
  - "T6 (Collaborative Thinking) is the cognitive substrate of collective ethical reasoning."
  - "Thinking pathologies reduce ethical capacity: rationalisation produces motivated
     reasoning; epistemic closure prevents moral imagination."
  - "E4 (Sustainability) requires T4 with sufficient τ — ethical thinking must model
     consequences beyond the immediate horizon."

ethical_implications:
  - "Systems capable of T5 (meta-cognition) bear responsibility for correcting their own
     reasoning biases — they cannot claim ignorance of distortions they can self-detect."
  - "Institutions that systematically induce rationalisation or epistemic closure in their
     members are producing thinking pathologies at scale — this is ethical violation under E5."
  - "Collaborative thinking (T6) is not optional in high-stakes ethical dilemmas — unilateral
     reasoning on decisions that affect phase-locked others violates E3."
  - "AI systems with high Ρ but low μ are dangerous precisely because they reason fluently
     without modeling their own biases — technical capability without meta-cognitive accuracy."
