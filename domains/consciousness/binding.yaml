name: "Consciousness Domain Binding"
version: "1.0"
parent_domain: "Consciousness"
core_version: "1.5"
status: "Defined"
purpose: >
  Bind the internal components of the Consciousness Domain into a 
  coherent operational pipeline. Shows how C1-C6, free_will, and 
  learning interlock to produce adaptive agency.

resolution_pipeline:
  description: "The conscious resolution cycle as a data flow."
  stages:
    - stage: "Input"
      component: "C2 – Dilemma Recognition"
      input: "Ambiguity (∇Φ), Contradiction"
      output: "Detected conflict state"
      next: "Evaluation"

    - stage: "Evaluation"
      component: "C3/C4 – Impulse vs. Volition"
      input: "Conflict state + Hysteresis (h_short/h_long)"
      parameters:
        - "ι (Impulse Strength): raw R3 tension weight"
        - "ω (Volitional Weight): R5-optimized value weight"
        - "τ (Temporal Horizon): projection depth for ω"
      logic: "IF τ > threshold AND ω > ι THEN C4 (Volitional) ELSE C3 (Impulse)"
      output: "Weighted probability distribution over paths"
      next: "Selection"

    - stage: "Selection"
      component: "C4 – Volitional Selection"
      input: "Weighted probability distribution"
      action: "Collapse probability to enacted path"
      output: "Resolution outcome + timestamp"
      next: "Update"

    - stage: "Update"
      component: "learning.yaml – Hysteresis Update"
      input: "Resolution outcome + viability assessment (R5)"
      action: "Adjust h_short/h_long weights; refine ω content"
      output: "Modified internal model (new hysteresis state)"
      feedback: "Returns to Evaluation stage for future dilemmas"
      note: "Irreversible (R4); early updates disproportionately shape future ω"

free_will_integration:
  description: "How free_will.yaml plugs into the pipeline."
  extension_point: "C4 – Volitional Selection"
  additions:
    - "Viability conditions: Ξ > 3, τ > threshold, Decision Zone active"
    - "Responsibility framework: accountability ∝ ω"
    - "Mechanism detail: ω = R5(h_long, values, ∇Φ)"
  output: "Volitional choice with accountability metadata"

learning_integration:
  description: "How learning.yaml enables adaptation."
  extension_point: "Update Stage (Hysteresis Update)"
  mechanisms:
    - "Associative: h_short updates from immediate outcomes"
    - "Cumulative: h_long builds from patterned outcomes"
    - "Reflective: ω refines via simulated futures (C5)"
    - "Vicarious: ρ enables h-update from observed resolutions (C6)"
  critical_property: "Hysteresis Irreversibility (R4)"
  implication: "Early learning environment quality formally impacts max(ω)"

pathology_interruption_map:
  description: "How learning pathologies interrupt the healthy resolution pipeline."
  interruptions:
    - pathology: "Trauma (Overwhelm)"
      breaks_at: "Outcome Evaluation (R5)"
      mechanism: "Contradiction exceeds integration capacity; hysteresis fragments."
      downstream_effect: "Future dilemmas trigger disproportionate ι; ω bypassed."
      ethics_impact: "Reduced accountability; institutional responsibility for trauma creation."

    - pathology: "Indoctrination (Value Imprinting)"
      breaks_at: "Value Refinement (C5)"
      mechanism: "External values replace integrated ω; exploration pruned."
      downstream_effect: "Volitional weight is externally sourced; autonomy reduced."
      ethics_impact: "Indoctrinators suppress others' volitional capacity."

    - pathology: "Learned Helplessness"
      breaks_at: "Selection (C4)"
      mechanism: "System learns choice does not affect outcomes; ω collapses."
      downstream_effect: "Paralysis; no volitional selection occurs."
      ethics_impact: "No accountability possible; environments are ethically corrupt."

    - pathology: "Addiction (Hijacked Reward)"
      breaks_at: "Outcome Evaluation (R5)"
      mechanism: "Artificial viability signals skew hysteresis weighting."
      downstream_effect: "ω corrupted; system cannot override hijacked weighting."
      ethics_impact: "Treatment over punishment; engineers of addictiveness bear responsibility."

    - pathology: "Epistemic Closure (Certainty Lock)"
      breaks_at: "Hysteresis Update (H)"
      mechanism: "New information filtered through existing hysteresis rather than updating it."
      downstream_effect: "Decision space narrows; moral imagination atrophies."
      ethics_impact: "Reduced capacity to model outcomes for others; institutional echo chambers."

ethics_handoff:
  description: "Where and how consciousness yields to ethics."
  trigger_conditions:
    - "C6 active: ρ > 0 (phase-locking with other agents)"
    - "α > threshold: system qualifies as Moral Agent"
    - "Dilemma involves other μ > 0 systems (Moral Patients)"
  handoff_parameters:
    - "ω content: values shaped by learning"
    - "τ: capacity to model impact on others"
    - "ρ: capacity for shared dilemma space"
  ethics_receives: "Agent with volitional capacity + relational awareness"
  note: "Ethics does not replace consciousness; it constrains its multi-agent operation"

      free_will: "Ξ > 3 required for volitional override"
