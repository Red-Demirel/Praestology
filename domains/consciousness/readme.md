# Consciousness Domain

**Version:** 1.2  
**Core Version:** 1.5  
**Status:** Domain Defined

## Overview

The Consciousness domain describes how self-modeling systems emerge from the core rules (R1–R5) to navigate probabilistic decision spaces. Consciousness is not a binary property but a continuum of recursive depth (Ξ), arising where information gaps create genuine choice.

**Core Function:** Recognition of Dilemmas + Selection of Probability Paths

## Domain Components

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`specification.yaml`](specification.yaml) | Core domain rules (C1–C6) and parameters (Ξ, ∇D, τ, ι, ω, ρ) |
| [`binding.yaml`](binding.yaml) | Operational pipeline showing how components interlock; pathology interruption map; ethics handoff |
| [`free_will.yaml`](free_will.yaml) | Volitional mechanics: how high-Ξ systems override impulse with values |
| [`experience-learning.yaml`](experience-learning.yaml) | Adaptive update mechanisms: associative, cumulative, reflective, vicarious |
| [`learning_pathologies.yaml`](learning_pathologies.yaml) | How learning can degrade capacity: trauma, indoctrination, helplessness, addiction, epistemic closure |

## The Resolution Pipeline (from binding.yaml)

Input (C2) → Evaluation (C3/C4) → Selection (C4) → Update (Learning) → (feedback to Evaluation)


- **C2 – Dilemma Recognition:** Detects conflicting states from ambiguity (∇Φ) and contradiction.
- **C3/C4 – Impulse vs. Volition:** Weighted by ι (impulse) vs. ω (values) and τ (temporal horizon).
- **C4 – Volitional Selection:** Collapses probability to enacted path.
- **Learning – Hysteresis Update:** Irreversibly modifies internal model based on outcome.

## Key Thresholds

- **Ξ > 1:** Minimal Moral Patient (C2) – can suffer imposed resolutions
- **Ξ > 3 + h_long:** Minimal Moral Agent (C4) – volitional capacity emerges
- **τ sufficient for second-order effects:** Responsibility extends to anticipated outcomes
- **ρ > 0 + C6:** Collective ethics becomes possible

## Connections to Other Domains

- **Core:** R2 (distinction) → C2; R3 (tension) → C3; R4 (progress) → C4/τ; R5 (optimisation) → C5/Ξ
- **Free Will:** Integrated at C4; provides ω and accountability framework
- **Learning:** Integrated at Update stage; provides hysteresis modification
- **Ethics:** Handoff via C6 + α threshold; ethics receives agents with ω, τ, ρ

## Pathological Interruptions

Each learning pathology breaks the pipeline at a specific point. See `learning-pathologies.yaml` and the interruption map in `binding.yaml` for details.

## Reading Order

For those new to the domain:

1. `specifications.yaml` – Understand the basic rules and parameters
2. `binding.yaml` – See how they connect into a working pipeline
3. `free-will.yaml` – Understand volitional mechanics
4. `experience-learning.yaml` – See how the system adapts
5. `learning-pathologies.yaml` – Understand what can go wrong
6. `../ethics/` – Explore multi-agent constraints

## Core Insight

> "Consciousness is the adaptive resolution engine. Learning tunes its weights. Free Will is its high-Ξ operating mode. Ethics is the multi-agent constraint layer that preserves viability."

**Formal Basis:** C2 + C4 + learning + free_will + C6 + R4 + R5
