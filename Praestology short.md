# Why anything exists at all - and why it never stands still
*Five conditions that seem to govern everything*

---

## Something always beats nothing
*Do we exist - is reality 'real'?*

Imagine truly nothing. No space, no time, no darkness, no emptiness - not even
the concept of absence. The moment you try to define it, you've already created
*something* - the idea of nothing. Perfect nothing is self-defeating. So something
has always existed, not because someone put it there, but because the alternative
is logically impossible. There was no beginning because there was never nothing
to begin from.

---

## Sameness is invisible
*Reality is what we can experience.*

If everything were identical in every way - same everywhere, and always - nothing
could be detected, measured, or experienced. Perfect sameness is indistinguishable
from nothing. So existence requires *difference*. Wherever something exists, there
are distinctions - here versus there, this versus that, more versus less.

---

## Differences create pressure to change

When two different things meet or coexist - warm and cold, high and low, full and
empty - there's tension. That tension doesn't sit still. It pushes toward
resolution. Water flows downhill. Heat spreads. Arguments get resolved or escalate.
A difference that just *sits there* unchanging would effectively be frozen. Tension
and resolution are the engine of everything that happens.

---

## Every resolution creates new differences

When tension resolves - water reaches the valley, heat distributes, the argument
concludes - something new has been created. The valley is now full. The room is
now warm. The relationship has changed. This means there are new differences, new
tensions, new resolutions. The process doesn't wind down. It regenerates and
progresses. A universe that reached perfect equilibrium - where everything was
resolved and nothing differed - would be indistinguishable from sameness we
couldn't experience. So it can't happen.

What we call *time* is simply what this progress looks like when measured from
inside a resolution sequence. Progress is the reality; time is how we count it.

---

## The process learns to survive

Not all ways of resolving tension are equally good at keeping the process going.
Some lead to runaway chaos - too much change too fast, everything flies apart.
Some lead to frozen stasis - if it's too rigid, nothing can move. Over time, the
paths that keep the process alive are the ones that persist. Reality self-tunes
because the alternatives don't last. This is why we live in a universe that's
neither pure chaos nor dead stillness. It found the zone in between - and stays
there.

This self-selection isn't guided by anyone. But at sufficient complexity it becomes
indistinguishable from a system trying to improve itself. Which is why complexity,
life, and intelligence aren't surprises - they're what sustained optimisation
inevitably produces.

## Closing words

We're a distinct part of a functional engine we perceive as reality. We matter, our actions have an impact to the future. Free will is the conscious ability to weigh reasons among the actually available options and choose an action, with the decision being exercised under given biological, social, and informational constraints.

---

## The short version

Nothing is impossible. Sameness is invisible. Differences create pressure. Pressure
creates change. Change creates new differences and progress. And the whole thing
is self-sustaining - not by accident, but by logical necessity.

Everything else - matter, energy, life, thought, ethics - is what that process
looks like from the inside.
