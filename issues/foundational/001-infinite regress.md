# Issue: 001-infinite-regress

## Status
Open

## Category
Foundational

## Core Problem
Does the resolution process (R3) itself generate an endless chain of meta-dilemmas? If every resolution requires a mechanism, and that mechanism itself constitutes a dilemma that must resolve, we risk an infinite regress that never reaches actual resolution.

## Why It Matters
This issue tests whether the core rules can cohere without an external stopping principle. If infinite regress is unavoidable and vicious, the framework fails to explain how any resolution actually occurs. If regress is virtuous or self-limiting, the nature of that limitation will constrain how we model recursive phenomena in domains like consciousness (self-awareness as infinite regress of self-modeling) and ethics (nested obligations).

## Current Understanding

### The Regress Problem
R3 states: "Differences create pressure — tension between distinct states drives change." But what drives the *resolution* itself? Consider:

- Dilemma D exists between states A and B.
- Resolution selects A over B (or some synthesis).
- But the selection process is itself a state transition requiring its own resolution mechanism.
- That mechanism faces its own dilemma, ad infinitum.

This resembles the homunculus problem in consciousness: who watches the watcher?

### Potential Responses

**Response A: The Regress is Virtuous (R4 Absorbs It)**
R4 states that "every resolution creates new differences." Perhaps the regress *is* the process. Resolution doesn't happen in a single step but as an endless cascade of micro-resolutions, each generating the next. What we call "a resolution" is actually a stable pattern within the cascade. This makes regress a feature, not a bug—it's the engine of perpetual motion.

**Response B: R5 as Regress-Halter**
R5 (Optimisation) selects for paths that sustain the cycle. Among those paths are *resolution shortcuts*—configurations where the mechanism is implicit in the dilemma itself. Some dilemmas might be self-resolving (e.g., logical tautologies require no external chooser). R5 amplifies such paths, effectively pruning the regress.

**Response C: Foundational Distinction Between Levels**
Perhaps we need to distinguish between:
- **First-order dilemmas**: tensions between states
- **Second-order dilemmas**: tensions about *how* to resolve
But second-order dilemmas are just dilemmas themselves, subject to R3. This doesn't halt regress; it just labels the levels.

**Response D: Acceptance as Boundary**
Maybe infinite regress is genuine and unavoidable, but resolution occurs *despite* it because existence (R1) simply *does*. This treats regress as a logical puzzle that doesn't impede actual process—akin to Zeno's paradoxes not stopping motion. The framework would then acknowledge regress as a boundary issue rather than solving it.

### Implications for Domains

| Domain | If Regress is Virtuous | If Regress is Halted |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Consciousness | Self-awareness is endless recursion; the "self" is a stable pattern within it | Consciousness bottoms out in a non-recursive foundation |
| Ethics | Moral reasoning is infinite regress; ethics is about navigating the cascade | Foundational values exist that halt regress |
| Physics | Quantum measurement may involve endless observer chains | Collapse occurs via a fundamental mechanism |

## Related Domains
- Consciousness (recursive self-modeling)
- Ethics (nested justification)
- Logical Dynamics (formalizing resolution)

## Next Steps
1. Examine whether R4's "every resolution creates new differences" necessarily implies infinite regress or merely a cycle.
2. Explore whether "self-resolving dilemmas" exist as a category and how R5 might favor them.
3. Consider if a distinction between "resolution" and "meta-resolution" is meaningful within the framework.
